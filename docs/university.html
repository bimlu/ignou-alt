Each School is headed by a Director who arranges to organise its academic programmes and courses in coordination with the School faculty and staff, and different academic, administrative and service divisions of the University. The emphasis is on providing a wide choice of courses atdifferent levels.</p><p><strong>The following Schools of Studies are in operation currently:</strong></p><ul><li>School of Humanities (SOH)</li><li>School of Social Sciences (SOSS)</li><li>School of Sciences (SOS)</li><li>School of Education (SOE)</li><li>School of Continuing Education (SOCE)</li><li>School of Engineering and Technology (SOET)</li><li>School of Management Studies (SOMS)</li><li>School of Health Sciences (SOHS)</li><li>School of Computer and Information Sciences (SOCIS)</li><li>School of Agriculture (SOA)</li><li>School of Law (SOL)</li><li>School of Journalism and New Media Studies (SOJNMS)</li><li>School of Gender and Development Studies (SOGDS)</li><li>School of Tourism and Hospitality Service Management (SOTHSM)</li><li>School of Interdisciplinary and Trans-disciplinary Studies (SOITS)</li><li>School of Social Work (SOSW)</li><li>School of Vocational Education and Training (SOVET)</li><li>School of Extension and Development Studies (SOEDS)</li><li>School of Foreign Languages (SOFL)</li><li>School of Translation Studies and Training (SOTST)</li><li>School of Performing and Visual Arts (SOPVA)</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="academic-programmes">Academic Programmes<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#academic-programmes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The University offers Certificates, Diplomas, Advance Diplomas, Post Graduate Diplomas and Degrees, which are conventional as well as innovative. Most of these programmes have been developed after an initial survey of the need for such programmes. They are launched with a view to fulfilling the learners’ needs for:</p><ul><li>Certification</li><li>Improvement of skills</li><li>Acquisition of professional qualifications</li><li>Continuing education and professional development at workplace</li><li>Self enrichment,</li><li>Diversification and updating of knowledge</li><li>Empowerment</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="course-preparation">Course Preparation<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#course-preparation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Learning material is specially prepared by teams of experts drawn from different universities and specialized
institutions in the area spread throughout the country as well as in-house faculty. The material is scrutinized by the
content experts, in -house faculty and edited by the language experts at IGNOU before these are finally sent for
printing. Similarly, audio and video materials are produced in consultation with the course writers, in- house faculty
and producers. The material is previewed and reviewed by the faculty as well as outside experts and
edited/modified, wherever necessary, before they are finally dispatched to the students, Study Centres and Telecast
through Gyan Darshan.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="credit-system">Credit System<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#credit-system" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Defining Credit in ODL
The University follows the ‘Credit System’ for most of its programmes. Each credit in our system is equivalent
to 30 hours of learner study comprisingall learning activities (i.e., reading and comprehending the print material, listening to audio, watching video, attending counselling sessions, teleconference and
writing assignment responses). Thus, a 4-credit course involves 120 hours of study and a 6-credit course
involves 180 hours of study. This helps the learner to know the academic effort he/she has to put in, to
successfully complete a course. Completion of an academic programme (Degree or Diploma) requires
successful completion of the assignments, practical, projects and the Term-End Examination as per
requirement of each course in a programme.</p></li><li><p>Choice Based Credit System (CBCS)
The Bachelor’s Degree Programmes offered through this prospectus follow the Choice Based Credit System
(CBCS) introduced by UGC. The CBCS provides the learner with flexibility to study the subjects/courses at
their own pace; greater choice of inter-disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and skill-based courses; and mobility to
different institutions for studies. The system has the following advantages:</p><ul><li>Allows learners to choose a combination of inter-disciplinary, intra-disciplinary courses, skill oriented
courses (even from other disciplines according to their learning needs, interests and aptitude).</li><li>Makes education broad-based and at par with global standards.
Offers flexibility for learners to study at different times and at different institutions to complete the
programme. Credits earned at one institution can be transferred to another institution.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="support-services">Support Services<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#support-services" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In order to provide individualized support to its learners, the University has a large number of Study Centres,
spread across the country. These Study Centres are coordinated by 67 Regional Centres and Recognised Regional
Centres. At the Study Centres, the learners interact with the Academic Counselors and other learners, refer to
books in the Library, watch/listen to video/audio programmes and interact with the Coordinator on administrative
and academic matters. The list of Regional Centres is given in this Prospectus. Support services are also provided
through Work Centres, Programme Study Centres, Skill Development Centres and Special Study Centres.</p><p><strong>In case the number of students enrolled in a program is small, the University shall provide Technology Enabled Learner Support (TELS) through Gyan Darshan / Gyan Vani Swayam</strong>
<strong>Prabha/ Web based support</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="programme-delivery">Programme Delivery<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#programme-delivery" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The methodology of instruction in this University is different from that of the conventional Universities. The Open
University system is more learner-oriented and the learner is an active participant in the pedagogical (teaching
and learning) process. Most of the instructions are imparted through distance education methodology as per the
requirement.</p><p><strong>The University follows a multimedia approach for instruction, which comprises:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Self Instructional Printed Material:</strong> The printed study material (written in self-instructional style) for
both theory and practical components of the programmes is provided to the learners in the form of a single
print book and/or e-book, comprising blocks and units or in the form of separate printed blocks for every
course (on an average 1 block per credit). A block which comes in theform of a booklet usually comprises
3 to 5 units.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audio-Visual Material Aids:</strong> The learning package contains audio and video programmes which have been
produced by the University for better clarification and enhancement of understanding of the course material
given to the learners. A video programme is normally of 25-30 minutes duration. The Video content is available on eGyan kosh (<a href="http://www.egyankosh.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.egyankosh.ac.in</a>) – the digital learning repository of the University.
<strong>The video programmes are also telecast on National Network of Gyan Darshan and Swayamprabha channels.</strong> All Gyan Vani stations broadcast curriculum-based audio programmes as per
their schedule that is notified in advance. In addition, some selected stations of All India Radio also
broadcast the audio programmes. Learners can confirm the dates for the programmes from their study
centres. The information is also provided through the university website.</p></li><li><p><strong>Counselling Sessions:</strong> Normally counselling sessions are held as per schedule drawn by the Study
Centres. These are mostly held outside the regular working hours of the host institutions where the study
centres arelocated. <strong>However, in case the number of students in a programme is small, face-to-face counselling shall not be organized. In such cases the University shall</strong> <strong>provide Web Enabled Academic Support to the learners.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Tele conferences:</strong> Live sessions are conducted via satellite through interactive Gyan Darshan Channel as
well as simultaneously webcaste at<a href="http://ignouonline.ac.in/and" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://ignouonline.ac.in/and</a> via Facebook Live sessions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practicals/Project Work:</strong> Some Programmes have practical/project component also depending upon the
learning requirements. Practical sessions are held at designated institutions for which schedule is provided
by the Study Centres. Attendance at practical sessions is compulsory. For project work, comprehensive
project guide, in the form of a booklet, is provided to the learner along with the study material.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="web-enabled-academic-support-weas">Web Enabled Academic Support (WEAS)<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#web-enabled-academic-support-weas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To provide technology based academic support to the learners of the distance mode programmes, IGNOU has
initiated a scheme of Web Enabled Academic Support (WEAS) for various ODL programmes of IGNOU. WEAS is a
Single Window Platform providing various kinds of academic support including the study material, audio-video,
quiz, discussion forum, calendar of activities, web-based video counselling, links of various web-based resources
to the distance learners by using simple and easily available ICT tools. The students enrolled in programmes being
offered through WEAS are given access to their programme specific portal in which they are provided with course
material in digital format, video and learning resources. The portal enables online peer-to-peer interaction and
discussion, it also gives an opportunity to the students to learn online and interact virtually with teachers and
experts. To access WEAS click the link - <a href="https://sites.google.com/ignou.ac.in/weas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sites.google.com/ignou.ac.in/weas</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="evaluation-system">Evaluation System<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#evaluation-system" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The system of evaluation followed by the University also is different from that of conventional universities.
IGNOU has a multitier system of evaluation.</p><ol><li>Self-assessment exercises within each unit of study material.</li><li>Continuous evaluation mainly through assignments which are tutor-marked, practical assignments
and seminar/ workshops/extended contact programmes, etc.</li><li>Term-End Examinations (TEE).</li><li>Project / Term-end Practical examination.</li></ol><p>The evaluation of learners depends upon various instructional activities undertaken by them. A learner has to
write assignment responses compulsorily before taking Term-End Examinations from time to time to complete an
academic programme. A learner has to submit Tutor Marked Assignments (TMA) responses to the Coordinator
of the Study Centre to which s/he is attached. <strong>Term-end examination is conducted at various examination centres spread all over the country and abroad in June and December every year.</strong></p><blockquote><p>IGNOU uses the following system of “Grading” for evaluating learners&#x27; achievement</p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th align="center">Letter Grade</th><th align="center">Qualitative Level</th><th align="center">Point Grade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">Excellent</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">B</td><td align="center">Very Good</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">C</td><td align="center">Good</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">D</td><td align="center">Average</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="center">E</td><td align="center">Unsatisfactory</td><td align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For Bachelors’ and Masters’ degree programmes, normally the system of numerical marking is followed, and the
marks secured in assignments, TE Exams, etc. are later converted into grades as per the five-point grading scale
given above. However, if required by the learner, the university provides numerical marks and division (I, II or
Pass).
IGNOU uses 10-Point Grading System for evaluating learners’ achievement for Bachelor Degree
Programmes under CBCS, as under:</p><blockquote><p>10-Point Grading System of IGNOU as per UGC-CBCS Guidelines</p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th align="left">Letter Grade</th><th align="center">Numerical Grade</th><th align="right">Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">O (Outstanding)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="right">≥<!-- --> 85</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A+ (Excellent)</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="right">≥<!-- --> 75 to &lt; 85</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A (Very Good)</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="right">≥<!-- --> 65 to &lt; 75</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B+ (Good)</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="right">≥<!-- --> 55 to &lt; 65</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B (Above Average)</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="right">≥<!-- --> 50 to &lt; 55</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C (Average)</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="right">≥<!-- --> 40 to &lt; 50</td></tr><tr><td align="left">D (Pass)</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="right">≥<!-- --> 35 to &lt; 40</td></tr><tr><td align="left">F (Fail)</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="right">&lt; 35</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ab (Absent)</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="right">Absent</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="term-end-examination-and-payment-of-examination-fee">Term-End Examination and Payment of Examination Fee<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#term-end-examination-and-payment-of-examination-fee" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>The University conducts Term-end Examination (TEE) twice a year in the months of June &amp; December.

If a deficiency is found in the application, you will receive a communication from IGNOU informing you about the discrepancy.

The forms are processed region wise on a first come first serve basis. Therefore, the time required for processing of forms for different Regional Centres may vary depending on the number of applicants from the respective regions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="if-i-want-to-withdraw-from-the-programme-after-confirmation-of-my-admission-shall-i-get-my-fee-refunded">If I want to withdraw from the programme after confirmation of my admission, shall I get my fee refunded?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#if-i-want-to-withdraw-from-the-programme-after-confirmation-of-my-admission-shall-i-get-my-fee-refunded" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Yes, University has a limited provision for cancellation of Programme and refund of fee as prescribed in the Refund Policy of the University. You may refer to the guidelines pertaining to ‘Refund of Fee’ under the ‘University Rules’ section of the IGNOU Common Prospectus. In cases where University denies admission, the programme fee will be refunded after deduction of processing fee, if any. The refund amount will be transferred electronically to the credit/debit/net banking account from where payment was made.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="as-a-student-of-ignou-shall-i-get-access-to-library-facility">As a student of IGNOU, shall I get access to library facility?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#as-a-student-of-ignou-shall-i-get-access-to-library-facility" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The students who seek admission to a programme of the University through Online Admission System will get the same facilities as those who join the programme in off-line mode. In case you are staying in the city where your Regional Centre is located, you can make use of the library at the Regional Centre. In addition, you can also use the multimedia facility (recorded audio/ video lectures, etc.) at the Regional Centre. Your Study Centre is also equipped with library/multimedia facility. You may use the facility during the working hours of the Study Centre.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-is-credit-system">What is Credit System?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-credit-system" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The University follows the ‘Credit System’ for all the programmes. Each credit in our system is equivalent to 30 hours of study comprising all learning activities (i.e. reading and comprehending the print material, listening to audio, watching video, attending counselling sessions, teleconference and writing assignment responses). Thus, a 4-credit course involves about 120 hours of study. This helps the learner to know the academic effort he/she has to put in, to successfully complete a course. Completion of an academic programme (Degree/ Diploma/ Certificate) requires successful completion of the assignments, practicals, projects and the term-end examination of each course in a programme.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-is-the-system-of-evaluation-followed-by-ignou">What is the system of evaluation followed by IGNOU?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-system-of-evaluation-followed-by-ignou" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The system of evaluation in IGNOU is different from that of conventional universities. IGNOU has a multi-tier system of evaluation - self-assessment exercises within each unit of study, continuous evaluation mainly through assignments which are tutor-marked, practical assignments and seminar/workshops/extended contact programmes, term-end examination, project work, etc. The evaluation of learners depends upon various instructional activities undertaken by them. A learner has to write assignment responses compulsorily before taking term-end examination from time to time to complete an academic programme. A learner has to submit tutor marked assignments (TMA) responses to the Coordinator of the Study Centre concerned to which s/he is attached.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="can-i-join-two-programmes-of-ignou-at-a-time">Can I join two Programmes of IGNOU at a time?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#can-i-join-two-programmes-of-ignou-at-a-time" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Students who are already enrolled in a programme of one year or longer duration can also simultaneously register themselves for any Certificate programme of 6 months&#x27; duration. However, if there is any clash of dates of counselling or examination schedule between the two programmes taken, the University will not be in a position to make adjustments. Simultaneously pursuing two academic Programmes of one year or longer duration either from the same University, or one from the Open University (under ODL mode) and the other from Conventional University (regular or face-to face mode) is not permitted, as of now.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="are-the-degrees--diplomas--certificates-awarded-by-ignou-recognized-by-ugc">Are the Degrees / Diplomas / Certificates awarded by IGNOU recognized by UGC?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#are-the-degrees--diplomas--certificates-awarded-by-ignou-recognized-by-ugc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Yes, recognized by UGC.
